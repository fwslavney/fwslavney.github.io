<hr />
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Select ONE of the three prompts below, and write a four page double spaced responce that clearly answers the prompts listed below.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>PROMPT ONE:</strong><br />Some observers have noted that the most conspicuous feature of moral theology since Vatican II is its shift from using the language of &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;human person.&rdquo; Discuss the significance of this change, explaining how this personalist foundation for morality is regarded to have been set forth by the Second Vatican Council and what is meant by the &ldquo;human person integrally and adequately considered.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>PROMPT TWO:</strong><br />Conscience has been described as &ldquo;the most secret core and sanctuary of the human person&rdquo; (<em>Gaudium et spes</em> no. 16). Examine the current understanding of conscience in Roman Catholic theological thought. In this investigation, consider the principal Roman Catholic sources available to assist a person in the formation of conscience, and explain why Catholic theological tradition holds that a person must follow the dictates of conscience.<br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>PROMPT THREE:</strong><br />The topic of sin has long been a major concern of moral theology. Discuss the various concepts of sin that are developed in the Scriptures, as well as some of the significant distinctions that have been made in Catholic theological tradition concerning our understanding of its reality. Be sure to include an appropriate approach to understanding sin today.<br /></span></p>
