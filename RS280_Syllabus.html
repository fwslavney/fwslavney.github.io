<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Required Textbook(s):</span> The following texts will be used and are required for this course. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Michael Walsh, <em>Roman Catholicism: The Basics</em> (Routledge, 2005) </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Lawrence S. Cunningham, <em>An Introduction to Catholicism</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2009). </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">John Farina, <em>Great Spiritual Masters</em> (Paulist Press, 2002). </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Robert Barron, <em>Catholicism</em> ( ) </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Pope Francis, <em>Lumen Fedei</em> (2013). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Course Description:</span> A study of the foundations of the Christian moral life, including freedom and moral agency, moral norms and moral reasoning, the place of scripture, tradition, and authority in the moral life, virtues and development of moral character. Pre-requisite: any 300 level course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Classroom Professionalism:</span> It is good to form a habit of behaving in a professional manner. Behavior that is prohibited includes: the use of inappropriate language; playing with cell phones, tablets, or laptops in class; falling asleep; being disrespectful to the professor or fellow classmates; not addressing a teacher (or any faculty) by his/her appropriate title; and putting legs/feet on the tables or desks. If a student engages in any of this behavior, he/she may be removed from the class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Attendance Policy:</span> Students are expected to attend all lectures. Attendance will be taken each day. Any student who has missed a total of three (3) lectures may be withdrawn from the course or given a mark of "F" at my discretion. Please, refer to the CBU Catalog. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">A note from the doctor is not an automatic excuse to be absent from class, tests, or quizzes. Prior approval MUST be obtained. Schedule your appointments so they do not interfere with your attendance to class. I decide what an emergency is, and I will decide if it should be considered for a make-up test. Consistent lateness will be subject to a deduction of a letter grade for each additional tardy occurrence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Participation/Application:</span> This class is driven by a lecture and discussion basis. You are expected to be active and attentive to all parts of the discussion. You are expected to participate in a constructive way in discussions and activities by (a) being on time and prepared for class, (b) sharing your comments and questions, (c) being alert and paying attention, and (d) showing respect for others. Offending someone&rsquo;s dignity or doing anything that goes against the code of conduct will not be tolerated. You will be given an F for this course and removed from the course permanently. <strong>(I have no leniency on this rule.) </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">You begin with a 72. As you participate, you earn a plus (+) which will raise this grade by two (2) points. Disruptive behavior of any kind will negatively affect your class participation grade. These actions will earn you a minus (&ndash;) which lower your participation by eight (8) points. This is 40% of your semester grade. Keep in mind that I average this separately with your semester average. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Example: A student has earned an 83 average in this class and has a 96 in participation. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">(83 x .6) + (96 x .4) = 88.4 which means that the student earned an 88 B+ in this course. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">In other words, the participation grade can be your best friend or your worst enemy. You decide! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Course Grading:</span> Letter grade assignments conform to the Christian Brothers University standard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">100 - 90 = A / 89 - 80 = B / 79-70 = C / 69 - 60 = D / 59 &amp; below = F </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Grading in this course will be based on the total points earned over the total possible points. I do not and will not round your final grade. If you have an 97.9999% you will have a 97.0 (A) average for the course. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Tests:</strong> There will be four in-class exams, each exam worth 200 points, and a comprehensive final exam worth 400 points.Study guides for tests and exams for tests will be posted on my website typically four (4) to five (5) days prior to the date of the test. I will not curve your test grades. If you miss a test for any reason, you need to notify me no later than the day after the test to set up a time for a make-up. Should you miss that make up date, you will receive a zero on that test and move forward. If you did not see me about a missed test within 24-48 hours&hellip;take a nice fat zero. (That can really hurt) There is no make up for the final exam! NO EXCEPTIONS! </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Quizzes:</strong> There will generally be one quiz per week, usually on a Friday, but there also may be pop quizzes. They will generally be very short and held at the very beginning of class. Quizzes are each worth 10 points and 10 of them will be counted. Since I plan to give many of these quizzes, (at least 15) I will drop the extra ones. Quizzes will tend to cover information in the readings, homework, and general class lectures. Quizzes cannot be made up. If you are absent and or late and miss a quiz, you will receive a zero on that quiz. I will let you know at the beginning of the quiz exactly how much time you will have. Quizzes will be typically multiple choice and true or false, or they may be short answer. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Homework:</strong> A variety of homework/in class assignments will be given throughout the duration of this course. Sometimes it may be as simple as a reading assignment to something as complicated as a reading analysis/synopsis essay. Any homework must be turned in using the proper format and on time. NO late (or incorrectly formatted, I will discuss formatting in class) homework will be accepted under any circumstances. If homework is not turned in AT THE BEGINNING of the following class period, a zero will be awarded for that homework assignment. There may be some extra credit opportunities during the semester, but there is no guarantee. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><strong>Projects/Papers:</strong> There will be a few papers or projects assigned throughout the semester. You will write two formal papers and a book review, each of which are worth 100 points. These papers are graded on grammar, format, and structure of your argument. These papers must be typed in the given format or else they will not be accepted, meaning a zero will be given. A late paper that is turned in late can only earn a maximum of a C (75%) at the very best, assuming it is a perfect paper. Formatting for the projects will be strictly enforced. Formal typed assignments may not be limited to projects. Specific details of individual project requirements will be given at the time that the project or assignment is assigned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fatal Errors:</span> Fatal errors are errors that you SHOULD NOT be making at this level of your academic career. They include, but are not limited to: calculations of simple areas and volumes, manipulations of linear equations, confusing &ldquo;there&rdquo;, &ldquo;their&rdquo;, and &ldquo;they&rsquo;re&rdquo;, confusing &ldquo;to&rdquo;, &ldquo;too&rdquo;, and &ldquo;two&rdquo;, confusing &ldquo;who&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;whose&rdquo;, confusing &ldquo;your&rdquo; and &ldquo;you&rsquo;re&rdquo;, sentence fragments, and ending a sentence with a preposition. Making errors such as these may result in an automatic zero on the problem in question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;">Utilizing source material that is not your own is acceptable as long as you cite the source properly. For correct citation procedures, you may utilize Turbian formatting requirements for citations. Failure to properly cite source material may result in an automatic zero on the assignment in question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Academic Honesty:</span> Grades are giving as an evaluation of your work. Any attempt to pass somebody else's work as your own will earn you a grade of F for the course.</span></p>
