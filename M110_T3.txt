Math 110		Review sheet for test 3			7 Nov.

Test 2 is Tu. 12 Nov. The topics for the test are from sections 10.4 and 10.5 
and trig identitites of Stitz Zeager and your notes. But you need topics from 
sections 10.1 - 4 of Stitz Zeager.
I will hold an optional review session on Mon. at 2 PM in CW 320.

Sec. 10.4 Trigonometric identities
State the even identities.
State the odd identities.
State the sum and difference identities for cosine.
State the cofunction identities.
State the sum and difference identities for sine.
State the sum and difference identities for tangent.
State the double angle identities.
State the power reduction formulas.
State the half angle identities.
Use the formulas to compute exact values of certain angles.
Verify trigonometric identities.

Sec. 10.5 Graphs of trigonometric functions
Describe a periodic function.
Describe the period of a periodic function.
Identify a periodic function that is not a trigonometric function.
State key properties of the cosine function.
State key properties of the sine function.
Make a five point graph of one period of f( x ) = sin( x ).
Make a five point graph of one period of f( x ) = cos( x ).
Describe the geometric transformations needed to transform y = sin( x ) into
    y = A sin( omega x + phi ) + B.
Describe the geometric transformations needed to transform y = cos( x ) into
    y = A cos( omega x + phi ) + B.
Find the period, amplitude, phase shift and vertical shift of
    y = A sin( omega x + phi ) + B and y = A cos( omega x + phi ) + B.
Write y = A sin( omega x ) + B cos( omega x ) as 
    S( x ) = C sin( omega x + phi )
Write y = A sin( omega x ) + B cos( omega x ) as 
    C( x ) = C cos( omega x + phi )
State key properties of the secant function.
State key properties of the cosecant function.
Make a six point graph of one period of f( x ) = sec( x ).

State key properties of the tangent function.
State key properties of the cotangent function.
Make a six point graph of one period of f( x ) = tan( x ).
Make a six point graph of one period of f( x ) = cot( x ).

Bring graph paper and paper to the test. The test requires the use of a
graphing calculator.
