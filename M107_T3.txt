identities. You will also need some topics from the first two tests.

Sec. 3.7 Inverses of functions
Describe the inverse of a function.
Describe a procedure to find the inverse of an invertible function.
Describe the relation between the domain and range of an invertible function
    and the domain and range of its inverse.
Find the inverse of a particular function.
Identify when a function has an inverse.
Describe the horizontal line test.
Explain restriction of domain.
Find the inverse of a particular function after restricting its domain.
Verify that the composite of a function and its inverse is the identity
    function.
Verify that the composite of the inverse of a function and the function is 
    the identity function.
Graph an invertible function and its inverse on the same set of axes.

Algebraic identities
